Django, Semi-Crispy, Inline Formset Example
============================================

I frequently need to make a web page with forms to support a model with a one to many link to another model (e.g.
a parent with children). This repo contains a complete example of how to do this, using Django crispy as much
as possible and with the children being a set of inline forms.
